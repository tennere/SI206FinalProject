SI 206 FINAL PROJECT 

BY: JULIA KAPLAN, EMMA TENNER, & YONIT ROBIN

IN THIS PROJECT WE USED THE BILLBOARD HOT 100 SONGS TABLE, DEEZER API, AND SPOTIPY API TO CREATE FOUR VISUALIZATIONS. 

ORDER OF RUNNING THE CODE:

Repeat 4 times: (1) hot_100_songs.py, (2) deezer.py, (3) spotifyInfo.py

Finally, run visuals.py.
